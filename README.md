This is a highscore server for our Global Game Jam 2020 game Who's In the Internet. Please don't worry about the commit messages as this was done as fast as possible.

# Development
This server runs on Heroku, but it can be used locally. You need a local mongodb service if you want to dev locally.

NodeJS and Yarn is required.


The process goes as such:

```
yarn
yarn start / node index.js
```
